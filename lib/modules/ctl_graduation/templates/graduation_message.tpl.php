<p><strong>Hi <?php print $graduate_name; ?>,</strong></p>

<p>Congratulations on graduating from the Crisis Counselor Training Program! I am so excited to welcome you to the amazing team of crisis counselors who help save lives every day. You're a newly minted crisis counselor, now what?</p>

<p>Good News! You are responsible for 4 hours per week of Crisis Counseling on our platform for 1 year but now you can split it into 2 (two-hour long) shifts! I know, this is different from what you heard in training. We listened to our community's requests and looked at the data. So, this is a brand new policy that all other Crisis Counselors will receive in January (you get first dibs!).</p>

<p><strong>Schedule Your Shift</strong></p>
